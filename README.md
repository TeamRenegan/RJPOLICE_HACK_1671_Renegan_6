## Introduction 

Welcome to Project Renegan, where innovation meets public safety! Our mission is to revolutionize crime detection and law enforcement efficiency by Geo-Tagging privately owned cameras. In collaboration with law enforcement agencies, we aim to create a comprehensive system that not only tracks camera locations but also facilitates quick access to crucial video footage during investigations.

Explore our cutting-edge solution that combines real-time incident analysis, precise location tracking, and seamless integration with AWS S3 for secure data storage. Join us on this journey to make communities safer and contribute to a smarter, more connected future.

Stay tuned for updates, and let's build a safer world together!

## Features

1. **Precise Location Tracking:**
   - Seamlessly monitor and track the locations of privately owned cameras within specified areas.

2. **Real-Time Incident Analysis:**
   - Utilize OpenCV for real-time analysis of incident videos, identifying specific objects and enhancing crime detection.

3. **AWS S3 Integration:**
   - Securely store and manage processed videos in AWS S3 for reliability and scalability.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Develop a user-friendly system for law enforcement to easily identify camera locations and retrieve specific video footage.

5. **Standardized Metadata Format:**
   - Establish a standardized metadata format for Geo-Tagged information, including camera specifications and owner contact details.

6. **License Management:**
   - Assign licenses to cameras for seamless interaction with the central Command and Control Center.

7. **Automated Checks:**
   - Implement mechanisms to automatically check for camera displacement, ensuring system integrity.
